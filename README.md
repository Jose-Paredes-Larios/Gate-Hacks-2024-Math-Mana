The ambition behind Math Mana was to create a fun and engaging educational game that allows students to practice and refine their math skills.
We envisioned the game involving a wizard fighting off hoards of enemies where the only way to defeat them was to answer a question correctly. 
We were also planning to incorporate generative AI to generate words of encouragement to the player, as they kept the hoards at bay. More importantly,
the generative ai would have also been used to generate a report on how the player is doing. It would highlight areas of math that the player is excelling in 
while also pointing out where they can improve and recommend levels based off the report. For example, if a player is struggling in multiplication, they would be
recommended levels that foucus on multiplication.
